SGSAFETY is a mobile application supplemented by a web application. The mobile app allows users to search for nearby AED devices and also access details of the AED device’s exact location. Users will also be able to navigate to the AED device using their mobile application. The mobile app also allows users to send an auto-generated text message with the user’s current location to SCDF. The web application also allows users to set up an account and declare themselves as CPR certified. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
SGSAFETY aims to fulfill 3 main purposes:<br>
(I)   Alert other users of nearby cardiac arrest cases based on their mobile device’s GPS location. By using our app, users will be able to send out an alert to other nearby users.<br>
(II)  Enable users to locate the nearest AED based on their current location. This feature enables users to retrieve AED devices and render help efficiently  <br>
(III) Automatically send a message to SCDF with information on the user’s current location and help required.<br>
